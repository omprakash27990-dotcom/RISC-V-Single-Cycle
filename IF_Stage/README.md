# IF Stage (Instruction Fetch)

Design the instruction-fetch stage: the program counter register and the next-PC selection.

### Module Specification


module if_stage (
    input  logic        clk,
    input  logic        reset,
    input  logic        stall,
    input  logic        and_out,
    input  logic [31:0] pc_signed_offset,
    output logic [31:0] address,
    output logic [31:0] pc_new
);

    logic [31:0] pc_next;

    assign pc_new = address + 32'd4;

    always_comb begin
        if (and_out)
            pc_next = pc_signed_offset;
        else
            pc_next = pc_new;
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            address <= 32'h8000_0000;
        else if (!stall)
            address <= pc_next;
    end

endmodule

### Working

- `pc_new = address + 4`.
- Next PC is `pc_signed_offset` when `and_out` is high, otherwise `pc_new`.
- On the rising edge of `clk` the PC register loads the next PC, **unless `stall` is high**, in which case it holds.
- On `reset` (asynchronous, active high) the PC becomes **`32'h8000_0000`**.

### Interface

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your module, port and parameter names are up to you. Your design must have the same number of ports, with the same directions and widths, as shown above, and must behave as specified. Map your names to this spec in `rnr-stage.yaml` (see the assignment handout).
